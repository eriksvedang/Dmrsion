1. Hands - the cards the players are holding in their hands, hidden from each other
2. In play - the cards each player has played in front of him or her on the table
3. Discard pile - a shared pile of face-up cards 
4. Deck - a shared pile of face-down cards


play a card = play a card from your hand, face up (not as a cheat) and unused
put a card into play = the same as 'play a card' but from another location (discard pile or deck)

Always perform as much of an effect as possible (unless it says 'may').

Trash = put a card (yours or opponent's) into the shared discard pile
The order of the cards in the discard pile does not matter.
A player can look through the discard pile at any time.

Used = the card is turned sideways
Unused = the card is tu
